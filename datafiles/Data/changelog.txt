Changes in v3.10.0-beta.1 (2022.03.29):
* The MP3 export back-end has been reworked from scratch:
   * Added stereo support! Panning on notes and layers will now be rendered
      correctly.
   * Added smart clipping detection! Clipping will no longer occur on louder
      parts of the song.
   * Fixed exported notes getting out of tune as they moved away from their
      original key.
   * The export time has been cut down by about 60%.
* Added an experimental drop mode! In this mode, instead of their usual grid
   arrangement, notes will scroll vertically and follow their corresponding
   key on the piano. This mode is only accessible in the player mode.
* Added smooth scrolling! The workspace no longer clips to the grid while the
   song is playing. This behavior can be enabled in Preferences > Playback. 
* The player mode can now be accessed from the greeting window, through
   a newly added button or by pressing F12.
* Added a fading border effect when removing a note block by right-clicking.
   This effect can be toggled in the Preferences.
* The note volume displayed on note blocks is now multiplied by the layer
   volume.
* The Note Block Studio icon has been updated. It's possible to return to the
   previous icon in Preferences.
* The color of the window title bar will now match the program's theme.
* The master volume bar can now be changed with the mouse wheel.
* Fixed a rounding error in the pitch calculation, which caused all played
   notes to gradually drift out of tune the more they moved away from their
   original key.
* Fixed the 'Get extra notes resource pack' button not working correctly.
* Fixed the master volume bar being changeable while a window is open.
* Fixed popups in the main area appearing while a window is open.
